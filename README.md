In this project, I designed and implemented a secure, efficient, and user-friendly door lock system using RFID technology integrated with an Arduino Uno microcontroller. The system automates access control and ensures enhanced security by replacing traditional locking mechanisms with advanced technology.

🌟 Project Highlights:
🔑 RFID Integration: Utilized an RFID reader module to authenticate users through unique RFID tags/cards, ensuring only authorized access.
🖥️ Microcontroller Programming: Developed robust Arduino code to manage data processing, user authentication, and control signals for the locking mechanism.
🔐 Locking Mechanism: Integrated a servo motor to physically lock/unlock the door based on successful authentication.
🛡️ Security Features: Implemented error handling to address invalid or duplicate RFID scans, ensuring the system's reliability.
📈 Scalability: Designed the system to be scalable for additional features, such as integrating a keypad, mobile app, or IoT connectivity.

⚙️ Technologies and Tools Used:
🔧 Hardware: RFID Reader (RC522), Arduino Uno, Servo Motor, Jumper wires, and Door Latch.
📟 Software: Arduino IDE for coding and debugging.
